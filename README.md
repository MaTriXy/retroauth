# A simple way of calling authenticated requests using retrofit
[![Snapshot build](https://github.com/andretietz/retroauth/workflows/Snapshot%20build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andretietz/retroauth/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Snapshot+build%22)


I split the project into 2 separate ones.

 * [retroauth](retroauth)
  This is the base implementation, to be used in plain java/kotlin projects.
 * [android-accountmanager](android-accountmanager/)
  On top of the pure Kotlin implementation there's the Android implementation, which uses the
Android AccountManager in order to store Owners (Accounts) and their Credentials.
